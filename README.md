# Bleach

This was my final project in CSC 214 Mobile App Development. The prompt for this assignment was "super-fan." As such, I decided to make my app about my favorite anime, Bleach. The practical function of the app is to help fans and people new to the anime catch up with the anime. As viewers of the anime watch the show, they can check off the anime arcs (storylines) that they finish. They can also see which episodes are part of which arcs. Fans can also explore backgrounds for their anime that they can use for their phone and save them if they want. Fans will also enjoy the function to build their dream team, as this is a shounen anime, featuring characters battling it out.

App also supports dark model and is localized in Japanese.
